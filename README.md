Flexible PHP5 framework for real-world web applications
=======================================================
[SIFO] is a well-proven open source PHP5 framework currently running on several
sites, from small installations to large websites with multiple servers.

SIFO is free and very easy to use. Contains a lot of libraries and classes that resolve your basic problems and allow you to focus in your business logic, at a very low learning curve. If there is a curve :)

It comes with several technologies *ready to use* such as Memcached, Sphinx, Mysql, Redis... and all the debugging tools.
